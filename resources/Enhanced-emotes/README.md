Based on emote scripts from Dolware and gui script from Ideo

This script is used to show emotes.

Controller users:
 - Down arrow to show/hide menu
 - Left/Right to navigate
 - A (or X on playstation controller i think) to validate
 
Keyboard users:
 - Down arrow to show/hide menu
 - Left/Right to navigate
 - Enter to validate
 
Those are default sellphone bindings, if you changed it, refer to sellphone binding menu on your game.

Enjoy !
